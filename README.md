# Coconut-Tree-Detection-from-High-Resolution-Imagery-Using-YOLO-in-Python
This project focuses on detecting coconut trees from high-resolution imagery using a dual-branch YOLOv11 model. It integrates geospatial preprocessing, training, and evaluation with per-class metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, mAP). The pipeline supports multi-band imagery and shapefile annotations for accurate tree mapping.
